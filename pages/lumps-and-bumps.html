    Lipoma

    Neurofibroma

    Dermoid cyst

    Pigmented moles

    Ingrowing toenails

    Infected sweat glands

Surgery for these conditions can often be undertaken under local anaesthetic in outpatients setting but sometimes general anaesthetic may be necessary depending on the size of the lesion and exact location.
