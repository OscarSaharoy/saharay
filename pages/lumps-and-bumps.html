Lumps & Bumps | Brentwood

There are many common conditions that require surgical removal either to relieve symptoms or get a definitive histological diagnosis.

Examples of such conditions include:

    Papilloma of skin
    Warts
    Sebaceous cyst
    Lipoma
    Neurofibroma
    Dermoid cyst
    Pigmented moles
    Ingrowing toenails
    Infected sweat glands
    Pilonidal sinus
    Solar keratosis
    Localised Skin cancers

Surgery for these conditions can often be undertaken under local anaesthetic in outpatients setting but sometimes general anaesthetic may be necessary depending on the size of the lesion and exact location.
