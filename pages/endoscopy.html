Endoscopy
Gastroscopy

A gastroscopy is a procedure to look at the inside of the oesophagus (gullet), stomach and duodenum using a flexible telescope. The procedure although uncomfortable is not painful and takes no longer than about 5 minutes. It can be performed with or without sedation, depending on your preference. With the telescope placed inside the endoscopist will be able to look into your oesophagus, stomach and duodenum and check for ulcers or growths. It is possible to take biopsies and perform other specialised procedures as necessary.

A gastroscopy can be recommended by your general practitioner for a variety of symptoms. A detailed information sheet regarding the procedure and the possible risks will be provided prior to the gastroscopy.

Colonoscopy

A colonoscopy is a procedure to look at the inside of the large bowel (colon) using a flexible telescope. The procedure is somewhat uncomfortable and is therefore performed under sedation often resulting in no recollection of the test later on. The colon needs to be emptied using a special laxative given orally the day before the procedure. The procedure itself can take up to 45 minutes. With the telescope placed inside the endoscopist will be able to look into the whole of your colon to check for various abnormalities ( for example – polyps, cancer and inflammation). It is possible to take biopsies and perform other specialised procedures as necessary.

A colonoscopy can be recommended by your general practitioner for a variety of symptoms, including change in bowel habit and rectal bleeding.

A detailed information sheet regarding the procedure and the possible risks will be provided prior to the colonoscopy.
