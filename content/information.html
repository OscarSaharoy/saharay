<p id="faq" class="heading"> FAQ </p>

<p class="heading small"> Where can I see Mr Saharay and how do I make an appointment? </p>

<p> Mr Saharay is available for Private consultation at The Spire Hartswood Hospital, Nuffield Brentwood Hospital, The Spire Roding Hospital, The Rivers Hospital and The Harley Street Clinic at Queens Hospital. To make an appointment, please ring your preferred hospital directly. Alternatively, you can ring Mrs Chrissie Turner on 07554993061 or Mrs Bernadette Murray on 07921456892 or send an email to info@saharay.co.uk. </p>

<p class="heading small"> What information do I need to provide? </p>

<p> You will need to provide your full name, date of birth, contact details, details of your GP, your insurance details if you are insured and your credit card details for any charges you may incur. </p>

<p class="heading small"> What do I need to bring with me to the consultation? </p>

<p> You need to bring a referral letter from your GP if one has not been sent already along with your insurance details including pre-authorisation number if applicable. </p>

<p class="heading small"> What happens if I need any tests/investigations? </p>

<p> The paperwork for any tests/investigations will be given to you at the consultation and you will be able to arrange these through reception or the nursing staff. If you are insured, your insurance company will cover the cost depending on the type of policy you have so it is best to check with them. If you are uninsured, please request for details of cost before the tests are undertaken. </p>

<p class="heading small"> How am I charged for services? </p>

<p> Charges are payable to Essex Surgical Practice for the Consultation but in addition there may be charges payable to the hospital if any procedure is undertaken in the out-patient department as part of the consultation. Invoices are raised within 24 hours of the consultation and are payable within 30 days. We are happy to invoice your insurer’s directly on your behalf if you are insured, but you would be liable for any excess or if the insurer’s refuse to pay, as the contract for payment for services provided is between you and Essex Surgical Practice and not with your insurer’s. Our charges are in accordance with most major insurer’s permittable fee schedule and you will not incur any shortfall. </p>

<p class="heading small"> How do I settle my invoice or any excess on my policy? </p>

<p> Please send a cheque made to “Essex Surgical Practice” and post it to us at 10 Lower Bury Lane, Epping, Essex, CM16 5HA </p>

<p class="heading small"> Where can I see Mr Saharay and how do I make an appointment? </p>

<p> Mr Saharay is available for Private consultation at The Spire Hartswood Hospital, Nuffield Brentwood Hospital, The Spire Roding Hospital, The Rivers Hospital and The Harley Street Clinic at Queens Hospital. To make an appointment, please ring your preferred hospital directly. Alternatively, you can ring Mrs Chrissie Turner on 07554993061 or Mrs Bernadette Murray on 07921456892 or send an email to info@saharay.co.uk. </p>

<p class="heading small"> Whom do I contact if I have any queries or need further information? </p>

<p> Please contact the hospital directly or Mrs Chrissie Turner on 07544993061 or Mrs Bernadette Murray on 07921456892 or by email atinfo@saharay.co.uk. </p>

<p class="heading small"> If I require surgery, how is it booked? </p>

At the consultation, you will be given a choice of likely dates which are suitable to you. You will need to liaise with Mrs Lynn Richards who will confirm arrangements and the hospital will also contact you.

<p class="heading small"> How do I obtain a fixed price quote for an operation? </p>

<p> If you are not insured, it is sensible to obtain a fixed price quote for the operation prior to surgery. The price quoted is a one off inclusive charge which includes the surgeons and the anaesthetist’s fee, the hospital charges and one post-operative out-patient follow up visit. Any additional procedure or hospital stay in case of complications arising from surgery is covered by the price quoted and you will not incur any additional cost. Please ring Mrs Chrissie Turner on 07554993061 to obtain a fixed price quote. Please note that the full charge will be payable to the hospital directly before you are admitted for surgery. This price does not include your initial consultation with the surgeon or any subsequent follow up appointment after the first post-operative visit. </p>

<p class="heading small"> Will I be provided with any instructions at discharge from hospital? </p>

<p> Yes, you will be provided with relevant information at discharge from hospital. You will also be provided with a medical certificate if you require for your employers and a follow up appointment will be made. </p>

<p class="heading small"> How do I arrange follow up appointments? </p>

<p> You can make a follow up appointment by ringing the hospital directly or by contacting Mrs Chrissie Turner on 07554993061 or by email to info@saharay.co.uk</p>

<p class="heading small"> If I am unhappy, how do I complain? </p>

<p> We pride ourselves in providing a high quality clinical service and patient satisfaction. If for any reason we fall short of your expectation, please contact us on 07554993061 / 07921456892 or email complaints@saharay.co.uk or the relevant hospital directly and we will endeavour to do whatever is necessary for a satisfactory resolution. </p>

<p class="heading small"> What are the costs? </p>

<p> Mr Saharay’s fee is £250 for initial consultation and £160 for follow up consultations. Any procedures undertaken during the consultation such as a rigid sigmoidoscopy or injection of haemorrhoids incurs an additional fee. If you are insured, then Mr Saharay will submit his invoice directly with your insurer and charge the fee agreed with the insurer so that you do not face a shortfall. </p>

<p id="clinic-handover" class="heading"> Mr Mrinal Saharay takes over Mr David Johnston’s and Mr Clive Hepworth’s Practice on their retirement </p>

<p> Mr Mrinal Saharay has recently taken over Mr David Johnston and Mr Clive Hepworth’s Practice and the on-going care of their patients following Mr Johnston and Mr Hepworth’s retirement from clinical practice. </p>

<p> Mr David Johnston wrote to his colleagues and General Practitioners: </p>

<p style="padding-left: 1rem;">“I am writing to let you know that I shall shortly be retiring from clinical practice.
<br><br>
I am very happy that I have been able to make arrangements for Mr Mrinal Saharay to take over my practice and the ongoing care of my patients. I have known Mrinal for many years, and I hold him in the highest regard. He practises the full range of procedures which I do, including Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, Hernia Operations, Gallstones, and Bowel Surgery etc. More importantly, perhaps, he is kind, sympathetic, understanding and caring in his attitude to the patients, and is very skilled from a surgical technical point of view, with excellent outcomes and results and very few complications.
<br><br>
Accordingly, I am very pleased that he will be taking over the care of my patients, and to know that they will be looked after in the manner I would wish.
<br><br>
I commend him to you as my successor.
<br><br>
My secretary Chrissie will be working for Mr Saharay for the foreseeable future to facilitate the handover.
<br><br>
Finally, I would like to thank you most sincerely for your support over the years, and for the very many referrals that you have sent.
<br><br>
With kindest regards and very best wishes for the future.” </p>
