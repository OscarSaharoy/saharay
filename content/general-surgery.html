<p id="hernia-repairs" class="heading"> Hernia Repairs - Brentwood </p>
<p> A hernia is a weakness in the muscles through which bowel can protrude. Hernias are most common in the groin and are called inguinal hernias. Other types of hernias include femoral, incisional and paraumbilical (around the belly button) hernias. Hernias commonly present as a lump which can be at times painful. Your general practitioner will take a history and examine you to confirm the diagnosis. Hernias need to be surgically repaired to relieve symptoms and prevent complications including strangulation (blood supply to the bowel is compromised) from happening. </p>

<p>Your general practitioner will refer you to see a surgeon who specialises in hernia repair. The vast majority of hernias are treated by an open mesh repair under a general anaesthetic but they can also be repaired by a laparoscopic technique (keyhole surgery). Most patients are able to go home within few hours after surgery with simple painkillers. You will be advised regarding driving and other activities, depending on the type of hernia and the extent of the surgical repair.</p>

<p>An information sheet regarding hernia surgery detailing the exact nature of the operation and the possible risks, depending on the type of hernia, will be provided prior to the operation.</p>

<p id="laproscopic-gall-bladder-surgery" class="heading"> Laparoscopic Gall Bladder Surgery - Essex </p>

<p> The gall bladder is a small sac like structure situated just below the liver on the right side below your ribs. It stores bile which is released after eating and helps with the absorption of fat. Gall stones can develop within the gall bladder for a variety of reasons and can cause repeated attacks of pain, jaundice and in some cases pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). [Gallbladder] Most patients who have gall stones complain of pain on the right side, just below the rib cage, spreading to their right shoulder or in a band like fashion to the whole of the upper abdomen. Your general practitioner will arrange for basic blood tests and an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis and refer you to a specialist surgeon. </p>

<p> Depending on the exact nature of your problem you may need further tests. Treatment in most instances would involve removing the diseased gall bladder, including the gall stones by keyhole surgery (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) which is performed under a general anaesthetic. In some patients keyhole surgery is inappropriate and occasionally the operation cannot be completed by keyhole surgery – in such cases the gall bladder is removed by an open procedure. Following laparoscopic cholecystectomy most patients are able to go home within 24 hours. Patients undergoing an open traditional operation need to stay in hospital between 48-72 hours. </p>

<p> A detailed information sheet regarding the procedure and the possible risks will be provided prior to the operation. </p>
