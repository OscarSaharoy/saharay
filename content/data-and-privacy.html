<p class="heading"> How your information is shared so that this practice can meet legal requirements </p>

<ul>
    <li> plan and manage services; </li>

    <li> prevent infectious diseases from spreading. </li>
</ul>

<p class="heading"> Rights to object and the national data opt-out </p>
<p> There are very limited rights to object when the law requires information to be shared but government policy allows some rights of objection as set out below. </p>

<p class="heading small"> NHS Digital </p>
<p> You have the right to object to information being shared with NHS Digital for reasons other than your own direct care. This is called a ‘Type 1’ objection – you can ask your practice to apply this code to your record. </p>
<p> Please note: The ‘Type 1’ objection, however, will no longer be available after 2020. This means you will not be able to object to your data being shared with NHS Digital when it is legally required under the Health and Social Care Act 2012. </p>
<p> The national data opt-out model provides you with an easy way of opting-out of identifiable data being used for health service planning and research purposes, including when it is shared by NHS Digital for these reasons. To opt-out or to find out more about your opt-out choices please go to NHS Digital’s website: <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/home"> https://digital.nhs.uk/home </a></p>

<p class="heading small"> Public health </p>
<p> Legally information must be shared under public health legislation. This means that you are unable to object. </p>

<p class="heading small"> Care Quality Commission </p>
<p> Legally information must be shared when the Care Quality Commission needs it for their regulatory functions. This means that you are unable to object. </p>

<p class="heading small"> Court order </p>
<p> Your information must be shared if it ordered by a court. This means that you are unable to object. </p>

<p class="heading small"> Right to access and correct </p>
<p> You have the right to access your medical record and have any errors or mistakes corrected. Please speak to a member of staff regarding our ‘subject access request’ policy. </p>
<p> We are not aware of any circumstances in which you will have the right to delete correct information from your medical record; although you are free to obtain your own legal advice if you believe there is no lawful purpose for which we hold the information and contact us if you hold a different view. </p>

<p class="heading small"> Retention period </p>
<p> Medical records will be kept in line with the law and national guidance. Information on how long records are kept can be found at: <a href="digital.nhs.uk/article/1202/Records-Management-Code-of-Practice-for-Health-and-Social-Care-2016"> https://digital.nhs.uk/article/1202/Records-Management-Code-of-Practice-for-Health-and-Social-Care-2016 or speak to the practice. </a></p>
