<p id="thyroid-surgery" class="heading"> Thyroid Surgery </p>

<p> The thyroid gland is a structure in the neck which produces a hormone called Thyroxine which regulates the body’s metabolism. Sometimes the gland may not produce enough hormone (hypothyroidism / underactive thyroid) and on other occasions it may produce too much hormone (hyperthyroidism / overactive thyroid). At other times the gland may enlarge in size to produce a lump in the neck (goitre). Your general practitioner will arrange for basic tests and refer you to see either an endocrinologist or an endocrine surgeon, depending on the exact nature of your thyroid symptoms. </p>

<p> Treatment depends on the exact nature of your thyroid problem which may either be taking medication or an operation. </p>

<p> An operation to remove either whole or part of the thyroid gland is called a thyroidectomy. A total thyroidectomy involves removal of the whole gland and a thyroid lobectomy involves removal of part of the gland. Sometimes for thyroid cancer, lymph nodes adjacent to the thyroid gland are removed as part of the operation. </p>

<p> We perform the operation under a general anaesthetic and it usually involves only an overnight stay in hospital. Latest techniques, including ultrasonic (Harmonic) scissors are used for the operation which results in very low blood loss and rapid recovery. The wound in the neck , which is about 5 cms long in the line of a skin crease, is closed with glue to avoid any marks on the skin from stitches. Most patients are able to eat and drink normally a few hours after the operation. </p>

<p> A detailed information sheet regarding the operation will be provided prior to the operation. </p>

<p id="parotid-surgery" class="heading"> Parotid Surgery </p>

<p> The parotid glands are large salivary glands, one on each side, situated in the angle of the jaw around the earlobe. They secrete saliva into the mouth. A growth in the parotid gland usually manifests itself as a slow growing lump around the earlobe. </p>

<p> Your general practitioner will refer you to an endocrine surgeon. Specific tests will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Most growths in the parotid gland are benign pleomorphic adenomas. If left untreated for a long period it can transform into a cancerous growth. The treatment involves removal of the part of the parotid gland containing the growth. </p>

<p> We perform parotidectomies under a general anaesthetic. The operation involves an incision along the front of the ear into the neck, depending on the position and size of the lump. The wound is closed with glue to avoid any marks on the skin from stitches. Most patients are able to eat normally after a few hours and are home within 24 hours. </p>

<p id="minimally-invasive-parathyroidectomies" class="heading"> Minimally Invasive Parathyroidectomies </p>

<p> The parathyroid glands, situated in the neck, secretes parathyroid hormone (PTH) which maintains the calcium level in the blood. Most people have four parathyroid glands, which are behind the thyroid gland. However, the number of glands and their position can vary. Calcium is important so that brain, nerves and bones all work properly. When a gland becomes over active and produces more parathyroid hormone it raises the calcium level in the blood (primary hyperparathyroidism). As a result calcium is diverted from the bones into the blood and excreted in the urine. Hence bones become brittle with increased risk of fractures and there is a higher risk of forming kidney stones. If the blood calcium level is raised substantially it may cause vomiting, collapse and heart problems. </p>

<p> Primary hyperparathyroidism can be diagnosed easily with a simple blood test. Your general practitioner will refer you either to see an endocrinologist or an endocrine surgeon. Further tests will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and also to locate the abnormal gland. Treatment for hyperparathyroidism is an operation to remove the abnormal gland as there is no effective long term medical treatment for this condition. </p>

<p> We perform a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy under a short general anaesthetic. The operation involves a 2 cm incision along a skin crease of the neck and usually takes less than 45 minutes. The wound is closed with glue to avoid any marks on the skin from stitches. Most patients are able to eat normally after a few hours and are home within 24 hours. </p>

<p> A detailed information sheet regarding the operation will be provided prior to the operation. </p>
