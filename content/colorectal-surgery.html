<p id="anal-fissure" class="heading"> Anal Fissure </p>

<p> This is a common condition which causes great misery. Typically the anus is split while passing a big hard lump of faeces often following a bout of constipation but there can be other causes. Defecation is extremely painful (described as passing glass) with some bleeding mainly on the tissue. The pain continues for several hours before gradually subsiding only to return at the next bowel movement. There are other conditions which mimic an anal fissure and hence expert medical opinion should always be sought. Initial treatment consists of simple measures such as analgesics, laxatives and creams such as Rectogesic or Diltiazem ointment for topical application. Sometimes surgical intervention is necessary if symptoms fail to respond to conservative treatment. </p>

<p id="anal-fistula" class="heading"> Anal Fistula </p>

<p> Another common condition in which there is an infected tract which connects deeply in the anal canal or rectum and superficially in the skin around the anus. It usually follows on from an anorectal abscess which bursts spontaneously or had been treated with inadequate surgery. There is continuous discharge of pus / faeces from the skin opening around the anal verge. There are various types of anal fistula and the internal opening can be low or high. In complex situations, an MRI scan is necessary to get an accurate picture of the extent of the problem. Surgical intervention is always necessary, including sometimes staged operations and use of seton along with a prolonged period of regular dressing for a permanent cure. </p>

<p id="haemorrhoid-surgery" class="heading"> Haemorrhoid Surgery </p>

<p> Haemorrhoids or Piles are engorged and prominent blood vessels just inside the back passage (anus). They cause fresh bright red bleeding when a motion is passed. They can cause itching and irritation around the anus and can cause discomfort and pain when they are advanced and prolapse through the anus. </p>

<p> Rectal bleeding can be due to other sinister causes (Haemorrhoids / colon cancer / colonic polyps) and should never be ignored. You are advised to consult your general practitioner who will discuss your symptoms and refer you for further specialised tests as necessary. </p>

<p> There are varying degrees of severity of haemorrhoids. Early haemorrhoids (internal haemorrhoids) are treated with dietary advice to avoid constipation along with injections or banding of the haemorrhoids. These procedures are performed in an outpatient setting and are only associated with minor discomfort. </p>

<p> Advanced haemorrhoids (external haemorrhoids) are treated by an operation. We perform the latest technique to treat haemorrhoids called a procedure for prolapse and haemorrhoids (PPH/circular stapled haemorrhoidectomy). The operation is performed using a special staple gun under a spinal anaesthetic (an injection into the back). This operation is less painful than a traditional haemorrhoidectomy and most patients are home within few hours with simple painkillers. A detailed information sheet regarding the operation will be provided prior to the operation. </p>

<p> The large bowel is made up of the colon and rectum. Colorectal cancer, or bowel cancer as it is commonly known, is the third most commonest cancer in the United Kingdom after breast and lung cancer. About 30,000 new cases of bowel cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK, of which two thirds are in the colon and one third in the rectum. </p>

<p> Common symptoms include bleeding from the back passage, a persistent change in bowel habit, a feeling of incomplete emptying of the bowel, unexplained weight loss, abdominal pain and anaemia. None of these symptoms should be ignored, particularly if there is a family history of bowel cancer in a close relative. These symptoms can also be caused by other diseases, such as haemorrhoids, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease or infections, all of which are benign conditions. Depending on your age, duration and severity of symptoms your general practitioner will arrange for further tests or referral to a colorectal surgeon. </p>

<p> Commonly a diagnosis of bowel cancer is made by inspection of the bowel by either a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy and biopsies are taken from the growth for histological confirmation. Further tests are carried out to confirm the extent of local disease and also its spread to other organs, like the liver and lungs. Once all the necessary information is available, it is discussed in a Multidisciplinary Meeting to formulate the most appropriate treatment plan, which is then discussed with the patient. </p>

<p> Depending on the site of the cancer and its stage, some patients may need some other form of treatment (chemo / radiotherapy) before proceeding to surgery. The type of surgery will depend on where the cancer is located and full information, including the risks will be explained to you by the surgeon prior to surgery. </p>

<p> However, some times surgery may be inappropriate and other forms of treatment, including palliative care, will then be considered. Over the last thirty years bowel cancer survival has improved markedly and five year survival rates for early cancers are around 93%. For more advanced cancers the five year survival rate will depend on a variety of factors, including age and other medical co-morbidities. </p>

<p> The NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is now well established across the UK. The aim is to diagnose cancers early and treat pre-cancerous growths, such as polyps, before they turn malignant. </p>

<p class="em"> Endoscopy </p>
<p id="gastroscopy" class="heading"> Gastroscopy </p>

<p> A gastroscopy is a procedure to look at the inside of the oesophagus (gullet), stomach and duodenum using a flexible telescope. The procedure although uncomfortable is not painful and takes no longer than about 5 minutes. It can be performed with or without sedation, depending on your preference. With the telescope placed inside the endoscopist will be able to look into your oesophagus, stomach and duodenum and check for ulcers or growths. It is possible to take biopsies and perform other specialised procedures as necessary. </p>

<p> A gastroscopy can be recommended by your general practitioner for a variety of symptoms. A detailed information sheet regarding the procedure and the possible risks will be provided prior to the gastroscopy. </p>

<p class="em"> Endoscopy </p>
<p id="colonoscopy" class="heading"> Colonoscopy </p>

<p> A colonoscopy is a procedure to look at the inside of the large bowel (colon) using a flexible telescope. The procedure is somewhat uncomfortable and is therefore performed under sedation often resulting in no recollection of the test later on. The colon needs to be emptied using a special laxative given orally the day before the procedure. The procedure itself can take up to 45 minutes. With the telescope placed inside the endoscopist will be able to look into the whole of your colon to check for various abnormalities ( for example – polyps, cancer and inflammation). It is possible to take biopsies and perform other specialised procedures as necessary. </p>

<p> A colonoscopy can be recommended by your general practitioner for a variety of symptoms, including change in bowel habit and rectal bleeding. A detailed information sheet regarding the procedure and the possible risks will be provided prior to the colonoscopy. </p>
